    <p><b>Nismo originally designed the concept of the Z-tune in 2002 when Nissan was putting an end to the R34 Skyline production. The first Z-tune was built in 2003, using a used 2002 Skyline GT-R V·Spec II.The Z-Tune had a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 3.8 seconds and has a top speed of over 327 km/h (203 mph).
    <br>Following the end of R34 production in 2002, Nissan announced they would separate the GT-R model from the Skyline name, creating an entirely new vehicle—though based on the same platform as the Skyline. This new car, now known simply as the Nissan GT-R, debuted in 2007 in Tokyo. Introduced to consumers in 2008, it was the first GT-R available worldwide, entering the North American market for the first time.
      The GT-R uses the Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the FM platform first used by the V35 generation of the Skyline.</b></p>
<br>
<h1>Banned!</h1>
<p><b>There is a great deal of false information floating around as to why Skylines were prohibited in the United States. Some have theorized that this was because they could readily outrun police cars like the Crown Vic and Chevrolet Caprice of the 1980s and 1990s. Some others believe that it’s because they are right-hand drive cars.</b></p>
